DECLARATION, DEFINITION AND INITIALIZATION
DECLARATION is the introduction of a new variable to the program and telling the compiler that it is to be used later but does not yet contain a value e.g
                 Var fruit;
                 Var name;
Definition is assigning a value to a variable that has already been declared e.g
                Var fruit = “melon”;
                 Var name = “Leslie”;
Initialization is the means of assigning an initial value to a variable. So undefined will be the initial value of a declared variable. e.g
               Var a = 2;
               Undefined
               a
               2
